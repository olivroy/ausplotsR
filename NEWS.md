# ausplotsR 2.0.0

## Breaking changes

* Default data download in `get_ausplots` now only includes `site_info` table (and not vegetation point intercept - veg.PI - nor vegetation vouchers - veg.vouch) due to increasing size of the dataset.

## New features and data

* Improved handling of revisit data:
  * Site revisit surveys now marked in chronological order for easier tracking.
  * Visualisation of changes along a sequence of visits to a plot.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
